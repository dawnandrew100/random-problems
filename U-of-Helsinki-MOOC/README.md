The courses are hosted by the University of Helsinki MOOC Center,
and no prior knowledge is required! Beginners can start learning programming basics
with the *Introduction to Programming* course, or get familiar with
artificial intelligence through *Elements of AI*.

This section of the repository will contain my solutions to the various exercises
within the Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) catalog from the University of Helsinki.
