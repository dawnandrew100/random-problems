# Question 1.13

Suppose that a spherical droplet of liquid evaporates at a rate
that is proportional to its surface area,

`dV/dt = −kA`

where V = volume (mm^3), t = time (min), k = the evaporation rate
(mm/min), and A = surface area (mm^2).

Use Euler’s method to compute the volume of the droplet
from t = 0 to 10 min using a step size of 0.25 min.
Assume that k = 0.1 mm/min and that the droplet initially has
a radius of 3 mm. Assess the validity of your results by
determining the radius of your final computed volume
and verifying that it is consistent with the evaporation rate.

## Assignment

- Upload the plot V=V(t) and your code implementing Euler algorithm.
- Explain what will happen with the droplet at t>10 min.
- Obtain analytical solution and compare it with the numerical one.
